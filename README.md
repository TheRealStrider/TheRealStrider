# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student learning many things to have a successful future as a network engineer.
I'm currently learning Java, Python, and also German (Deutsch). I might also start learning Swedish or Russian but for now I think German will do.
As of now, I'm creating a Minecraft mod called the Colored Wood Mod, well a remake of my original version anyways, and also maintaining a website where I publish all the projects I am making.

## Future
As wanting to become a Network Engineer, I of course started to learn programming languages such as Java and Python.
I might actually also learn C++/C#, or even Lua to increase my knowledge but also to have a higher chance of getting a job.
I graduate high school in 2023 so I don't have much time before I go to college. I'm currently taking AB Calculus for math which will really help for when I enter college.

## Language Learning
### Languages for general use
As stated above I am learning German. I use Duolingo for vocabulary and other websites for grammar.
Apart from Swedish and Russian, maybe I might do French or just follow up on my Spanish. Took two years of Spanish in high school so I remember basic stuff but definitely need a brush up on stuff.
I started German because of my ancestors being German and also because I admire the language and culture. I also planned on moving to Germany so I obviously need to know the language.

### Programming Languages
As of right now, I only know HTML and CSS and have a certification for them. I'm taking a class for Java and Python but I use Java right now for my Minecraft mod.
I plan to learn more languages to be able to fullfill different requirements from different people.

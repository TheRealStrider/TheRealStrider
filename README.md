# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student learning many things to have a successful future as a network engineer.
I'm currently learning Java, Python, C++ and Kotlin for programming languages while learning German, Spanish, Swedish, and French for world languages.
As of now, I'm creating a Minecraft mod called the Colored Wood Mod, well a remake of my original version anyways, and also maintaining a website where I publish all the projects I am making.

## Future
As someone wanting to become a Network Engineer, I of course started to learn things in advance before going to college.
I might actually also C# to increase my knowledge, but also to have a higher chance of getting a job.
I graduate high school in 2023, so I don't have much time.

## Language Learning
### World Languages
As stated above, I am learning four languages apart from already knowing English. I use Duolingo for vocabulary and other websites for grammar.
I find knowing and understanding different languages quite interesting and plan to be a polygot in the future. My main focus is mastering German to at least have a B2 level of knowledge as I plan to move to Germany.

### Programming Languages
As of right now, I only know HTML and CSS and have a certification for them. I'm taking classes in Java and Python while mainly using the internet for the other two.
I plan to learn more languages to be able to fulfill different requirements.

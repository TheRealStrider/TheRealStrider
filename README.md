# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student learning many things to have a successful future as a network engineer.
I'm currently learning Java, Python, C++ and Kotlin for programming languages while learning German and Norwegian for world languages.
As of now, I'm creating a Minecraft mod called the Colored Wood Mod, well a remake of my original version anyways, and also maintaining a website where I publish all the projects I am making.

## Future
As someone wanting to become a Network Engineer, I of course started to learn things in advance before going to college.
I might learn C# to increase my knowledge, but also to have a higher chance of getting a job.
I graduate high school in 2023, so I don't have much time.

## Language Learning
### World Languages
I use Duolingo for vocabulary and other websites for grammar.
I find knowing and understanding different languages quite interesting and plan to be a polyglot in the future. My main focus is mastering German to at least have a B2 level of knowledge as I plan to move to Germany.

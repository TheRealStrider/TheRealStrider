# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student learning many things to have a successful future as a network engineer.
I'm currently learning Java, Python, and Lua for programming languages while learning German, Spanish, Swedish, and Japanese for world languages.
I might also start learning French or Russian but for now I think I'm doing plenty for now.
As of now, I'm creating a Minecraft mod called the Colored Wood Mod, well a remake of my original version anyways, and also maintaining a website where I publish all the projects I am making.

## Future
As wanting to become a Network Engineer, I of course started to learn things in advance before going to college.
I might actually also learn C++ or C# to increase my knowledge but also to have a higher chance of getting a job.
I graduate high school in 2023 so I don't have much time before I go to college. I'm currently taking AB Calculus for math which helps for the math portion of college.

## Language Learning
### World Languages
As stated above I am learning four languages apart from already knowing English. I use Duolingo for vocabulary and other websites for grammar.
I find knowing and understanding different languages quite interesting and plan to be a polygot in the future. My main focus is mastering German to at least have a B2 level of knowledge as I plan to move to Germany.

### Programming Languages
As of right now, I only know HTML and CSS and have a certification for them. I'm taking a class for Java and Python while mainly using the internet for Lua.
I plan to learn more languages to be able to fullfill different requirements for different people.
